			<p>The wandering albatross has the longest wingspan of any living bird, typically ranging from 2.51 to 3.5 m. They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. They excrete a high saline solution from their nose. </p>
